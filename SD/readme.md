# SYSTEM DESIGN ~ []()

### Prerequisites Computer Science Subjects
1. Data Structures and Algorithms
2. Object-Oriented Programming
3. Computer Networks
4. Database Management Systems
5. Operating Systems
6. Software Engineering

### Beginner 
1. Learn about system design principles: Start by learning about the principles of system design. This includes topics such as scalability, fault tolerance, availability, and performance. There are many resources available online to help you learn about these principles, including blog posts, videos, and online courses.

2. Study real-world examples: Study real-world examples of systems that have been designed to solve similar problems to what you are working on. Analyze the architecture of these systems and try to understand the design decisions that were made.

3. Practice designing systems: Once you have a good understanding of system design principles and have studied real-world examples, start practicing designing systems yourself. You can start with simple systems and work your way up to more complex ones.
